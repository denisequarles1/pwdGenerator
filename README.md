## Description
The purpose of this website is to provide a way for a user to create a secure password between 8 to 128 characters that includes at least one of the following character types:<br>
 
 * Uppercase characters
 * Lowercase characters
 * Numbers
 * Special characters

The user will click the "Generate Password" Button and will be prompted to answer questions regaarding the character types to include in the password. Once this is selected, the password will be displated in the Your Secure Password textbox.

While working on this project, I learned about prompts, arrays, loops and if statements.
