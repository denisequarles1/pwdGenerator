## Description
The purpose of this application is to provide employees with access to senstive data a tool to create a secure password to ensure the data is protected. The secured password will be based on character criteria they select. The password length must be between 8 to 128 characters and will include at least one of the following character types:<br>
 
 * Uppercase characters
 * Lowercase characters
 * Numbers
 * Special characters

The user will click the "Generate Password" Button and will be prompted to answer questions regarding the character types to include in the password. Once this is selected, the password will be displated in the Your Secure Password textbox.

While working on this project, I used prompts to display instructions to users.  I also used arrays to contain the character type data. Arrays, loops and if statements were used to manipulate the data to create the secure password.
